*Protein sequence analysis & classification*

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About InterPro

InterPro provides functional analysis of proteins by classifying them into families and predicting domains and important sites. 
We combine protein signatures from a number of member databases into a single searchable resource, 
capitalising on their individual strengths to produce a powerful integrated database and diagnostic tool. 

## üîç Browse InterPro

InterPro is available at [ebi.ac.uk/interpro](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/).

## üíª InterProScan

InterProScan is the software package that allows sequences (protein and nucleic) to be scanned against InterPro's signatures. 
Signatures are predictive models, provided by several different databases, that make up the InterPro consortium.
